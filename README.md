# videoplayer

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I have made this flutter app with the help of tutorials available on YouTube and various sites.

I have only implemented firebase authentication and a landscape video player.

We just have register on the app when we open for the first time.

If loggged out, we just have to sign in again to watch the video.
